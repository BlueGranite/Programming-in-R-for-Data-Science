***  

#### R Intro and Lab setup
  * Use 'Introduction-to-R-BlueGranite.pptx' for intro slides
  * Use 'lab-setup.md' for setup instructions 
  
1. #### Introduction
  * Use 'Introduction.pdf' for slides
  * Use 'Introduction.R' to show code from slides
  * Use 'Exercise1.R' for exercises
    - Skip exercise 1.1 (confusing as a first exercise)
    - Knowledge checks and Lab can be done in-class or later depending on time.  
      But it might be good to walk through the UI for the first one in-class
      
2. #### Functions and Data Structures
  * Use 'Functions and Data Structures.pdf' for slides
  * Knowledge Checks and Lab should probably be done outside of class
  
3. #### Loops and Flow Control
