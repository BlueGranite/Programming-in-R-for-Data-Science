[Microsoft R Client](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-r/r-client-install) is a free, data science tool for high performance analytics. R Client is built on top of Microsoft R Open so you can use any open source R packages to build your analytics. Additionally, R Client introduces the powerful ScaleR technology and its proprietary functions to benefit from parallelization and remote computing. Microsoft R Open is the enhanced distribution of R from Microsoft. It is based on R and includes capabilities for improved performance and reproducibility. Like R, Microsoft R Open is open source and free to download, use and share. 

Currently, Microsoft R Client is available only on Windows.

6. For class, I recommend using the R client [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/). You also have the option of installing [R Tools for Visual Studio](https://aka.ms/rtvs-current), an integrated development environment. R Tools for Visual Studio is a free add-in for Visual Studio that works in all editions of Visual Studio. This option is only available if the supported version of Visual Studio is already installed.
